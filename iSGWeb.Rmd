Move away from eBook paradigm
- basically "static" 
- reader behaviour (studying)

To adaptive learning
- customise based on user account
- track and synchronize reading 
- adapt to user pace and learning

## Why change to: 
- ## HTML   `r emo::ji("thinking")`

## What's wrong with:

- ## PDF  

- ## ePUB
]
.pull-right[

???

PDF
- static, non-interactive, no-media
- doesn't render well on current mobile devices
- but printing is excellent because of fix format

ePUB
- was "text" based
- bandwidth savings no longer an important issue
- besides videos and chunked-lessons are now external
- excellent rendering and interactivity, but html can do more
- including server-side calls
- local storage

HTML
- more consistent and wider range of rendering
- wider range of devices
- longer shelf life
- better development tools
- server-side applications
- server-side storage

## iSG Rendering on SUSSReader

## HTML Renders the same way...

???
- The same rendering is afforded in HTML 
- HTML offers more flexibility
- Need to transition out of a e-book paradigm
- iSGWeb will be a self-learning portal

### Advantages:

- HTML is more .brown[consistent] and plays well across devices
  
- can program for .brown[synchronization] with user accounts

- can program for external or non-SUSS .brown[subscription] accounts

- can program for .brown[learning paths]

- can program .brown[recommendations] with graph based or ML based analyses

- can program free and priced content with .brown[e-payment] systems

- web-development (.brown[full-stack programming]) allows for a lot more tech solutions
