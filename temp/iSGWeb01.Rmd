## Why do we need to change to HTML?

#`r emo::ji("thinking")`

## What's wrong with:

- ###PDF

- ###ePUB
]
???

PDF
- static, non-interactive
- doesn't render well on current mobile devices
- printing matters, but we can do more if on HTML

ePUB
- was "text" based
- bandwidth savings no longer an important issue
- besides videos and chunked-lessons are now external
- excellent rendering and interactivity, but html can do more
- including server-side calls
- local storage

HTML
- more consistent and wider range of rendering
- wider range of devices
- longer shelf life
- better development tools
- server-side applications
- server-side storage

## Renders the same way in HTML, but yet...

???
- The same rendering is afforded in HTML 
- HTML offers more flexibility
- Need to transition out of a e-book paradigm
- iSGWeb will be a self-learning portal

### ...except we can do more things in HTML
### ...and with server-side programming

### Advantages:

- HTML is more .brown[consistent] and plays well across devices
  
- can program for .brown[synchronization] with user accounts

- can program for external or non-SUSS .brown[subscription] accounts

- can program for .brown[learning paths]

- can program .brown[recommendations] with graph based or ML based analyses

- can program free and priced content with .brown[e-payment] systems

- web-based framework (.brown[full-stack programming]) allows for a lot more tech solutions
